The OutputFiles directory is the default location for JDXConverter output files.
The directory OuputFileExamples contains examples of the JDXConverter output.
Output files will be created with a number at the end (such as "1, 2" etc. to avoid overwriting outputs from previous runs. The skv file has ";" separated columns, and the tsv file has tab separated columns.
