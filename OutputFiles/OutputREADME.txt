This OutputFiles directory is the default location for outputed files, although the user is able to specific different output locations
if they would like. 
Addtionally, the file ConvertedSpectraExample contains an example of the programs output from the JDX files that are
provided in the directory JDX-Files.   
NOTE TO USERS: 
When JDXConverter is run twice with the same specifications, it will overwrite the previous version of ConvertedSpectra.csv. Move or 
rename the old version of ConvertedSpectra to preserve both copies.
