This OutputFiles directory is the default location for JDXConverter output files, though the user can specify an alternate ouput location during runtime. 
The file ConvertedSpectraExample contains an example of the JDXConverter output.
Output files will be created with a number at the end (such as "1, 2" etc. to avoid overwriting outputs from previous runs. The csv file has ";" separated columns, and the txt file has tab separated columns.
